    <h1>Journey</h1>
    <p>My name is Suraj KC, and my journey has been a blend of dreams, challenges, and growth. Born and raised in Nepal, I grew up in a family that valued education and hard work. From an early age, I was curious and eager to learn, which led me to explore various fields of study and personal interests.

        In school, I had a keen interest in subjects like Computer Science and Management. Though my academic path wasn’t without its hurdles, I completed my 12th grade with determination, securing a GPA of 3.14. These years taught me the value of perseverance and how small achievements can build a strong foundation for the future.
        
        After high school, I started teaching as a tuition teacher, sharing knowledge with younger students. This experience not only helped me grow as a person but also taught me the importance of patience, empathy, and communication. While teaching, I realized how much I enjoyed solving problems and creating solutions, which eventually fueled my interest in programming.
        
        Starting with C++ during my school days, I’ve since learned HTML, CSS, and am now diving into JavaScript, focusing on arrays and other core concepts. I dream of becoming a programmer and aspire to develop unique software or applications that solve real-world problems. I am passionate about creating something meaningful, especially a project that could make a difference in Nepal.
        
        Life hasn’t been without challenges, especially the decision to study or work abroad. Coming from a modest background, finances have always been a factor in my choices. I’ve learned to budget carefully and have sought opportunities where I could balance work and studies to support myself.
        
        Despite these challenges, I remain optimistic and focused on my goals. The idea of studying Computer Science at a reputed university abroad motivates me to work harder. I’m also exploring ways to improve my IELTS score to expand my opportunities further.
        
        Through it all, I’ve realized that success is not just about reaching milestones but about the journey itself—learning from every step, staying humble, and pushing forward. My story is still being written, and I’m excited for the chapters yet to come</p>
