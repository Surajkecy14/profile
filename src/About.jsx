      <p>
        I’m a front-end developer passionate about creating accessible, visually
        appealing, and user-centric digital experiences. I love working at the
        crossroads of design and technology, where creativity meets
        functionality to deliver seamless and performant web solutions.
        Currently, I specialize in crafting responsive interfaces and exploring
        modern web technologies like React.js. My recent focus has been on
        building scalable components and layouts tailored to enhance usability
        and accessibility for diverse audiences. Previously, I’ve worked on
        various projects ranging from small-scale personal websites to
        e-commerce platforms, honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        while continually embracing new challenges. My journey also includes
        self-learning and applying innovative approaches to web design and
        development. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me sipping a hot cup of
        tea, exploring new ideas, improving my skills, or brainstorming ways to
        make impactful contributions to the digital world. I also enjoy
        connecting with the community and sharing knowledge that inspires
        others.
